        <p>Manual testing of "https://www.banglashoppers.com/" registration and login pages involves ensuring prominent display, completeness of required fields, successful account creation, and proper error messages. 
          User interface evaluation is crucial, with a focus on user friendliness and ease of understanding. Security testing ensures sensitive information is encrypted and prevents vulnerabilities like SQL injection and session hijacking. Compatibility testing ensures consistent functionality across different web browsers and devices, while performance testing assesses response times under different network conditions. Error handling is crucial, with user-friendly error messages displayed. Border testing ensures input field input lengths are handled correctly, session management ensures secure session management, and forgotten password functionality is tested. 
          Localization and language support should be tested with different languages to ensure proper translation and display of text and UI elements.</p>

      <li><a href="https://ummemaria.github.io/api-testing/">API testing</a>
        <p>API (Application Programming Interface) testing is a type of software testing that focuses on testing the APIs of an application or system. APIs serve as the communication channels that allow different software components or systems to interact with each other. API testing involves evaluating the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of these APIs to ensure they work as expected and provide accurate responses.</p>
                
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://ummemaria.github.io/performancetesting/">Performance testing</a>
        <p>Performance testing is a crucial type of software testing used to evaluate the speed, responsiveness, stability, and scalability of an application or system under various conditions. 
          Its primary goal is to ensure that the software can handle the expected workload efficiently and provide a satisfactory user experience. 
          Performance testing is usually conducted during the later stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) to identify and rectify performance bottlenecks before the application is deployed to production.</p>
